# landing-page

This is a basic landing page of a sample website. The purpose of this project is to put all of my skills so far to the test! This page was made from scratch, to test my abilities to create html and css files, add headers, footers, links, images, and style the entire layout to match the given assignment design layout from The Odin Project.

Enjoy!
